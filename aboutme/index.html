    <h3>What I've accomplished</h3>
    <p>
        <!-- Where it all started... -->
        (2019)
        I started programming in the Unity Engine, that's where I got
        the basics of C#, then I continued learning it without the engine.
    </p>
    <p>
        (2020) I continued making bad games with Unity, and also started programming with LUA in the Roblox Engine (ROBLOX STUDIO).
    </p>
    <p>
        (2021) I started making some Discord bots with Discord.py (in Python, obviouvsly).
        Then I actually learned C++ and done like one project with the SFML graphics library.
    </p>
    <p>
        (2022) Here we are. In this year I'd like to learn the Rust programming language 
        and learn how to make a complex Website with Node.
    </p>
    <p><b>🗓️ Let's se if I'll be able to accomplish these tasks!</b></p>
